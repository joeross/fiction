## Chapter One

The car was pure calm, parked with the keys on the passenger seat. It was quiet the way you think of space as quiet. He was sitting in the driver's seat, his neck bent down. He was lightly pinching his nose between the index finger and thumb of his right hand, taking slow, deep breaths. He was steeling himself for re-entry, for the transition from the car's space-silence back into the whirring machinery that was everything outside the car. He took his hand away from his face but did not look up, instead taking off his seat-belt and picking up the keys from the passenger seat.

The parking lot was at his back as he made his way into work. The walkway was tight, the width of a deer trail and crowded with overgrown foliage, the business version of a lazy neighbor's unlandscaped front yard. He squinted, moving his head from side to side the way a robot might conduct a thermal scan for lifeforms on an unexplored planet. The brightness was new, a side-effect of the city's demolishing the abandoned public school across the street. He saw people, dogs, birds trees, cars and clouds in his periphery, but those hardly registered at all.

Today was the day he would be fired. He knew because the Director had dropped the letter from her briefcase the day before as she hurriedly locked her office door and scrambled to the parking lot. He had picked it up, read it, pushed his upper lip up with his lower lip, shook his head slowly in the affirmative, and put it in a recycling bin. He expected she would have a freshly printed copy waiting for him this morning.

His chest felt tight. The building seemed to bend in the middle as he approached, threatening to bring a hulking cinderblock fist down on him. He stopped at the bottom of the steps, already sweating through his shirt at the small of his back in a scorching June afternoon. He added that embarrassment to the mental ledger in which he recorded life's steady parade of subtle indignities.

The image of her handing him that copy with a forced frown and a feigned sense of regret faded out and the world around him faded back in. Children flowed into the building, giving him the same berth they would give a pillar or a fence. He taught creative writing in a school where creative writing was a one-way ticket to being called weird and boring. There were three hundred students at the school in an average year and at any given point in time no more than eight knew his name. He took a sad comfort in knowing he wouldn't be missed much.

The flow of kids into the building slowed to a trickle and he walked up the stairs into the lobby. The entrance sat on the southeast corner of the structure and when you entered the lobby you faced down the long hall that made one of the two longer sides of the building's uninspired rectangle. The long, slender fluorescent lights made the whole thing look like some sort of scientific experiment. He ascended the cramped stairwell to the left of the reception desk and pushed hard on the fire door at the top.

His was the only classroom in use on the corner of the building, so he always had to flip the switch to illuminate the hall. He had no office of his own, as most of the other full-time teachers had, so he always went directly to his classroom. He expected the Director would make her way up to him shortly after the eight o'clock bell.

She would come in with a smile on her face, forced almost to the point of causing her physical pain. She would say his name with a slow, friendly inflection. She would sit down at the front-most, center-most desk as if they were about to chat about one of those vapid things people commonly chat about. Then she would hand him the letter, silently, and while he pretended to read it for the first time she would relax her forced smile into a frown that seemed to match her face far better anyway. Then she would get up and leave.

This scene played out only ten minutes after he imagined it, with slight variations in lighting, temperature and inflection.

Mara Wilson was driving her offensively red 1998 Honda Accord with the serpentine trajectory of a car piloted by a woman brushing her hair, checking a pimple in the rear view mirror and trying to un-stick her right foot from the driver's side floor mat so she could make use of the brake pedal if necessary (it was necessary).

She stopped abruptly at a traffic light and noticed a strong, burning-rubbery odor. She leaned out her window and tried to look at the wheels of her car while the motorist behind her pressed the horn on their steering wheel, alerting her to the change in the traffic light from red to green. Her foot came un-stuck from the floor mat again and she pressed it down on the gas pedal. She squinted and frowned when the car lurched forward reluctantly, refusing to accelerate beyond a few miles per hour (about 4.82803 kilometers per hour, for readers preferring the metric system of measurement).

The emergency brake was engaged, and as she disengaged it the Beeper, the person driving the car behind her, who had honked their horn at her for failing to accelerate when the traffic light turned green, accelerated to her left and passed her on the road. The Beeper glared at Mara Wilson as if the several seconds during which he had waited for her to notice and respond to his Beep had forever lost him some irreproducible opportunity for enlightenment and empowerment and glorification. She watched him speed off ahead of her and, about one hundred yards away (91.44 meters), brake hard and turn sharply into the "adult" movie theater.

Enlightenment, empowerment, and glorification.

While Mara Wilson was busy internally, silently, but severely judging the Beeper for both his rudeness and his vice, a large white smear appeared as if by magic on her windshield, directly in her line of sight. Of course, it did not appear by magic, but as the result of the surprisingly complex digestive system of a pigeon.

He sat cross legged on the cold linoleum floor. The musty and disturbingly sweet scent of something too much like mold not to be mold seemed invisibly to ebb and flow about the head of George Dart. Three lonesome metal prongs, slightly bent away from one another by years of rough albeit very occasional use as the refrigerator made its way over the decades around the perimeter of the kitchen, lay at the terminus of a too-short power cable. George suspected after a moment of contemplation that this fridge, its power source cut off for no one really knows how long, was the source of the musty and disturbingly sweet scent of something too much like mold not to be mold.

The Lawyer sat at the decades-old oak table next to her client, an aged white man wearing a suit that was expensive when he bought it but has aged worse than he has aged. An faint but intricate system of roads and canals mars the table's dusty surface, carved by years of pens and dug-in fingernails and binder clips and the sliding of stapled papers. The power had momentarily gone out, again, leaving the courtroom lit only by the mote-filled shafts of sunlight wedged diagonally between the two full-height windows and each shaft's terminus on the marble floor. The power momentarily went out for several moments a day, the mountain town's aging power grid occupying a relatively low position on the township commissioners' list of budget priorities.

The Lawyer was writing in her stereotypical legal pad, yellow and slightly frayed at the corners the way a well-used notebook tends to get. Opposing counsel was questioning his client on direct examination and The Lawyer was taking notes, in an admittedly shaky version of her handwriting, without looking down from the witness stand at her pad. The effect of this was to make her look as though she was simultaneously trying to engage the witness in a staring contest and practicing the dark art of automatic writing.

It was never the experience of dying that occupied his mind, but the anticipation. No, that suggests a looking forward to something. The certainty. That's closer. It was the certainty of death, and the paradox that he could never shake: most of his waking moments he spent in a silent, first-world sort of terror born of his knowledge of his own mortality. But when he was dead he would feel nothing, be nothing, and so he wouldn't be comparing being dead to the alternative.

He thought of it suddenly one day, backing his nondescript Japanese sedan into the parking space outside the Court Administration building of a Pennsylvania mountain county. He worked there in a nondescript bureaucratic role, but right now he was thinking that we all realize at some point in our maturation that we are mortal and that we, and everyone else we know or will know, will die.

Religion helps some cope, while science gives nonbelievers a rational framework for the seemingly bottomless emptiness of living with an expiration date, an emptiness either somewhat reduced or greatly exacerbated, depending on the type of person we're talking about, by the knowledge that they may not even see it coming before it's too late. The Willfully Ignorant (W.I.) put this issue to the side and can live a productive and happy life with their inevitable end dancing ever at the periphery but no closer. He reasoned, as he turn the key toward him in the ignition to deactivate the car and pulled up the emergency brake, that this inevitable end, or rather the knowledge of it, must be the default meaning of life.

He had had this idea that everyone made their own meaning of their life, which he thought he had come up with himself but actually he had read on a greeting card. Those who don't or can't or won't make their own meaning, though, can default to one of several options, including anarchy, apathy, and what he called the Default Meaning. The Default Meaning (D.M.) is that while knowing we will all die may at first seem to suck the meaning out of every moment of our lives, we can expend our energy on maximizing the joy, safety, learning and empathy of those among us too young yet to reach the Darkest Realization (D.R.), or those who are intellectually incapable. Everyone, the D.M. posits, deserves the absolute best, most fun, most loving, most loved period of years prior to the D.R. because that period is the height of innocent possibility and the sense that we are all infinite, which of course we are not, but which of course we often wish we were, or at least had the option to be.

Raymond Maine killed twenty-year-old Rebecca Nelson in the weakest sense of accidentally, high on medication for which he had no prescription and driving a car he was well past the point of being able to drive in any meaningful way. Rebecca, track team captain and, for that matter, captain of just about every other sports team she had ever wandered onto, was jogging in the neighborhood around her house. Maine, whose mind at the time we can't know and honestly who would want to know it, caused the vehicle he was trying to drive to leave the reflective-painted bounds of the road and collide, fatally for her, with Rebecca Nelson as she jogged.

The Lawyer sat in the attorneys' gallery, stage-right of the judge's bench, watching Rebecca's father, and then her mother along with two photographs of Rebecca, explain with a convincing combination of emotion and logic why they wanted the Judge, please, Your Honor, to give Maine the absolute longest most severe extended possible sentence His Honor was empowered to impose. Maine's lawyer asked him immediately before sentencing whether he had anything he wished to say. Maine said he didn't kill Rebecca on purpose, but by accident, as a result of mismanagement of his bipolar manic depression medication. He said he had dealt with the condition for more than twenty years, the irony of that length of time not lost on Rebecca's family.

He said he respected Rebecca's parents, who had been to every court hearing since their daughter's death. He said he joined a volunteer rescue squad and then fire department for ten years, a role which the District Attorney said Maine had used to take money from strangers for a nonexistent 9/11 charity.

Long pauses filled the spaces between Maine's sentences and stuttering and occasional cracking marked his voice throughout his soliloquy. He had saved lives, he said, almost implying that he had built up some sort of death credit, allowing him to kill, accidentally anyway, with impunity, a certain amount of people until the number killed equalled the number saved, and only then to be held accountable for homicide, only for those he killed after the balance of his death credit had run out, down to zero.

Rebecca's parents, John and Margaret, looked back and forth between Maine and the floor. They wore poker faces except for the occasional moment here and there when Maine said something that made them wince, or almost imperceptibly shake their head, or lock eyes and squeeze one another's hand. The judge made the mistake, during an especially long pause, of asking if Maine had anything else he wanted to say, which mistake precipitated an additional ten minutes of monologue which may not otherwise have accosted the ears of John and Margaret and Rebecca's friends sitting in the public gallery behind the parties' tables.

"This isn't an excuse, this is just information, explanation, just so you know, just, just so you don't think, so you don't think I'm," was the kind of thing Maine was saying to no one in particular, his eyes fixed and empty on a point at the center of the circular state seal affixed to the front of the judge's bench.

A sky like this one happens every few years, or at least that's about as often as it sticks in our memory. Soren Bachman is scowling his way through his fourteenth birthday on the beach in a New Jersey shore town the name of which both escapes me and is inconsequential to my ability to tell this story and to your ability to understand and, if I tell it at least passingly well, for you to enjoy it.

A thick fluffy layer of gray clouds moves unbroken across the sky above Soren and his classmate, Jason Miller, who is hunched over a garbage can twenty yards down the beach from Soren, lighting match after match from a matchbook with a naked lady on it holding a torch but lacking any identifying mark such as a product or brand or establishment name, and dropping them into the can.

"Sorry, get over here, it's about to go up!" Jason is not scowling at all, but smiling so widely when he cranes his neck around to shout at Soren that he looks for a moment like some deranged clown whose makeup has all been washed away by the wet salty pre-storm seaside air swirling around him.

Soren is disinclined to interact with anyone lacking the good old common decency to respect his inner world, to scowl even a little bit in even the faintest showing of something like empathy or support or solidarity or at the very absolute least neutral and detached recognition of what is happening in his head.

Feeble wisps of smoke are creeping over the edge of the garbage can when Jason takes several steps backward, holds up a small three dimensional rectangle and squeezes it in the general direction of the can. Soren is unusually skilled in interpreting the fragmentary scenes we all catch occasionally in the periphery of our field of vision but hardly notice, let alone pay attention to, let alone become skilled, let alone *unusually* skilled, in interpreting.

"I've seen fire before, Jay. I don't *need* to see fire, in a can, on the beach." Now it's raining on them in that slow way that makes you feel simultaneously like maybe you're being spit on by someone really tall but also that it's not so bad to be rained on sometimes.

"In a can, on the beach, in the rain."

"But Sorry, this is no ordinary fire! There are plastics and the plastics are burning in colors you don't see fire in very often, not in fires, anyway, in a can, on the beach, in the rain. Don't think I just do this stuff *for fun* or out of some misguided sense of rebellion. Of course not." Jason is starting to sound sincere, which, Sorry thinks to himself, doesn't often happen, and ought to at least be recognized, as Sorry wishes his inner world would be, with, at the very absolute least, neutral and detached recognition. He walks over to the garbage can, Jason's grin widening with Soren's every step.

"It's not as easy as you might think, Sorry. There are all kinds of plastics. You have your thermoplastics, cellulosics, fluorocarbons, nylons, polyphenylene, vinyls, polyblends, and thermosets. And those are just the ones I know. They're always inventing new ones." Jason looked up to gauge his listener's interest. Soren looked up from the flames and waved his right hand in a circle at chest level to tell Jason to continue his exposition.

"Anyway, depending on which one you're dealing with you're usually going to get a blue or yellow flame, blue with yellow tips, yellow with blue tips, yellow with blue edges, blue with yellow edges, sometimes smoke, sometimes not, sometimes melting and dripping, sometimes not." [^1]

"How the hell do you know this? Who knows this stuff?" Soren was smiling when he said it but clearly expected an answer. This was the way of their friendship, an awkward amalgamation of question and answer, revolving around musings few other people cared about or thought fourteen year olds could intelligently discuss, and around the arcane minutiae of industrial arts the existence of which was of no moment to the overwhelming majority of people not standing on that beach.

"Okay, yes, that's a good question. It really opens the door to the history of my plastics studies, which is not going to be the most exciting story you've ever heard, despite what I consider its relatability and the utility of the lessons I learned studying plastics in more generalized studies. Analogies, metaphors, parables, case studies. These are all useful to everyone, and all possible if you know enough about plastics."

You wake up and there's no question you're not supposed to be here. Thirty two should be your senior associate year at a firm, or the year you finally have your feet under you as the writing pressure you never were, not yet anyway. The year you and you wife happily purchase a home as per the American dream and whatnot. But today, like every day whose memory is sufficiently distinct in your sorrow-addled mind to even call a different day-to-day you wake up and there's no goddamn question about it that you were never supposed to end up like this, do this to your wife, to yourself, to your cats. You are still terrified by the cold finality of death but wholly disinterested in whether or not you remain alive. You search thoughts like the preceding sentence for some sort of zen value, for wisdom in the static, but all you can ever seem to do, with the medicine and the goddamn journal and the long drives and the fast food alone in your parked car at nine o'clock p.m. is to develop a sense that you have the capacity to Figure It All Out but will never possess the clarity of mind or resourcefulness of action to do just that. It's barely this week for you these days before it's next week and this week, the first week I just mentioned, is last week. Living like riding in a rusty old Radio Flyer down a steep hill that looks interminable at first but then looks less and less interminable until you think you see the bottom rushing up toward you, which observation you know is a function of general relativity and not an indication that the bottom is really riding toward you. Really you're falling and falling, we're all always falling, in a way. And someday everything, everyone hits the ground. Bummer.

The year. The catcher and whatnot priority, I have a great time in your parked on my phone was in a Rheingold and whatnot, but all the time I have no clue where the time to go with me know when you're ready for a few hours, but I have no idea who are not going anywhere else is the best of all time favorite part in a way to go back to me know if we are to do just fine with the stuff I need a Rheingold the bottom is not an option for you these are just some things that I can get.

You search engine. You are not allowed the stuff you are going well! We can go with it was in your life to the stuff and then you will find that I am a big believer. You can also find the right thing I don't think it's time for you to get it is the stuff I can put in the stuff and I can do the bottom is a function in your addled and I have to be careful and whatnot priority to do it on the bottom rushing to be careful about it and the fast, to yourself in a rusty, I can do that you were in a rusty old and new phone, to be honest I'm just gonna get it done by a rusty. I have to admit it or something else in your parked at a rusty, to be here.

Darryl Friedman's first invention was also his first patent, awarded in February of 2019. It looked like a lipstick, small and cylindrical and smooth. A user pressed a small button in the top of the cylinder which activated a complex static electrical field, pulling all of the pet hair from the clothes of the man nearest person to the device and combining it all into a single unit, for use by bald men as a hair piece or as pillow stuffing or in repulsive-yet-fascinating art projects. It had the unfortunate side effect of collecting lint as well as pet hair, and the augmentation meant to exclude pet dander from the accretion process was not yet included in the patent, which would need revision to account for that omission.

At fourteen years of age, Darryl's choice of problems to solve tended to skew oddly toward those of older people. His first invention, at age ten, while not patented, was a local sensation and sold hundreds of units. It consisted primarily of a repurposed telescoping radio antenna attached to an ergonomic handle and equipped, at the far end, with a vertical locking mechanism that prevented it from closing, from telescoping back into itself, when put to its intended use. That intended use was for the manipulation of buttons on pre-remote control cabinet television sets.

This invention had the benefit over later wired and then infrared remote controls of being extremely difficult to lose or break by stepping upon. It had the particular *disadvantage* of being an exceptionally effective weapon for use by unruly children against one another, or against pets, or against parents, or against grandparents, which fact resulted in its early abandonment by couples with young children or frequently visiting grandchildren. As those children grew up though and their parents and grandparents beat back the cruel advance of time with a steadfast refusal to replace their cabinet televisions, a long tail of utility for the antenna remote sustained a surprisingly steady stream of sales.

--- above written 150918 at 9:27:41 AM ---

The Teacher had been more a fan of the antenna remote than the later and far more advanced static electrical pet hair remover. Darryl valued his opinion and enjoyed being treated like an equal in conversations with The Teacher. The Other Teachers treated him as if he was fourteen, which, of course, he was, in a biological and linearly temporal sense, but it still aggravated him. Darryl had been invited several times to attend one or two courses at the Rapid Valley Community College and The Teacher had urged him to try it out, to study basic engineering and calculus to give his natural talent and passion for invention a technical foundation and set himself up to more easily appear, and be, a fully competent inventor when he finally did find himself surrounded by intellectual equals who treated him as such.

But The Teacher was fired yesterday, and while no one knew exactly why, he was well-liked and rumors did not exceed the absolute minimum one would expect in a school as large as Darryl's. He had gone to see The Teacher after school and found him in his office, sitting at his neatly organized wooden, older-than-Darryl-and-possibly-even-older-than-The-Teacher desk. He was calm, slowly swirling some spilled ink around on the last blank page of a spiral-bound notebook. The Teacher took notes throughout the day, about techniques that worked and things the kids didn't like, ideas he had for future lesson plans and general observations about life. He looked up when Darryl entered the room and said, quietly and without irony or anger, "They fired me today, Darryl."

Darryl said he was sorry and why, and would he be allowed to come back and visit them, or would he still proofread Darryl's technical documents if Darryl would mail them to The Teacher's home, and why did they fire him and when is his last day, is it today, and, he repeated, he was sorry?

"It doesn't matter why, suffice it to say that it's nothing scandalous, I'm not a weirdo or a a drunk or anything like that." He sounded jovial, but his face betrayed the person-sized maelstrom of hurt swirling around inside him. Darryl thought that, while The Teacher was smiling, it was a wan smile, and it seemed like an inverse eclipse, pale and bright on the inside but surrounded by a cloudy dark penumbra suspended in the space around The Teacher's head.

There is a peculiar subset of overeducated underachieving autodidact (O.U.A) who, while they may master their own chosen art or science, most revels in the intellectual criticism, from a technical perspective, of the art and science of others. They are, just like their undereducated over- and/or underachieving counterparts, primarily first and foremost, despite their preference for a chapter in a novel over an episode reality television or public radio over Top 40, consumers.

It is likely that you shook your head in the affirmative upon reaching the end of that paragraph, which seems like a good time to switch to the first-person and disclose, in case the obnoxiously long but, I swear otherwise well-constructed, sentences haven't yet given me away, that I am one of those O.U.A.

I find movies, horror movies especially, bring this less than desirable trait of mine into stark relief. I, with nothing but a 101-level cinematography course on my *curriculum vitae*, can expound at great length and with minimal irony upon what I would do differently if I were the writer or director of whatever film I am watching. This inclination goes well beyond a simple everyday manifestation of the "everyone's a critic" cliché. I can describe, in excruciating detail, the different locations I would have chosen, the different time of year during which I would shoot, the different actors I would have at least tried to hire, and, this one is perhaps the worst because it most closely relates to my chosen art, how differently I would have written the thing. Plot devices, character development, establishing shots and dialogue. Dialogue is always, without fail, the most disturbingly talentless and apparently-totally-ignored-by-the-makers-part-of-a-film, in my totally amateur and unqualified opinion.[^2]

## Chapter Two

"When are you going to move out?"

David's voice was steady the way a traffic jam is steady, with the occassional gas-break staccato that crept into it when whenever he fought with Kathleen. Kathleen was reading a book but David couldn't see which one because she had taken to using some sort of plain book jacket she ordered special online to conceal the actual jacket of whatever book she was reading. This was a calculated manuever the cleverness and unspoken exclusionary nature of which David felt a great respect for, along with the contempt and impatience it inspired in him.

"I am reading, which is something you should consider doing more of yourself, if for no other reason than to calm your fraying nerves a bit."

She had an infuriating way of modulating her serenity which was always, invariably, inversly proportional to not only the level of David's frustration but to, more specifically, the rate of acceleration of that frustration toward outright anger. This was another characteristic of hers which David simultaneously admired and despised. But neither of them was physically combative, so she pressed on while he, desprately trying to match her calm and making himself angrier in failing.

"You can read and make smug comments all night, I'm not going to try to stop you, firstly because it's a free country and all that and secondly because god what a waste of time it would be to try to convince you to do something you don't want to do."

David was not tactful in his quarreling strategy. When a statement or rhetorical question produced a one-eyed glance over the book or a nearly inaudible *hmph* or sucking-of-teeth sound, he was a shark swimming headlong into a fresh current of bloody chum.

"In fact, I bet you're not even reading, I bet the book is upside down or randomly chosen from some thrift store-destined pile of unreadable dreck. You're sitting there on that couch, from which, I might add, you have yet to provide an answer to the question with which I opened this unpleasant exchange." David smirked like a obnoxious child smirks at that age between cute and sentient when you're always waiting for them to, accidentally or otherwise, do something extremely dangerous to themselves or others. It was a terrible smirk to have to look at while you're having a conversation, and an even worse one to have pointed at you while you're trying to read.

Kathleen began reading from the mystery book in a loud well-projected voice.

"Here / underneath / our myriad feet / the asphalt tries to speak," she began. "In fear / retreat / our myriad feet / as sky begins to leak. Here / under me / only my two feet / there is power in the discreet." She had by the end of the passage raised her left hand in the manner of a televangelist and started gesticulating with her right hand, in which she held the book. Her furious waving of the book around and around suggested she had actually memorized the quoted passage, leaving David suspicious still that she was not reading anything at all and had merely planted herself in the room and waited for him with the goal of engaging in the ferocious tête-à-tête in which they had been engaged since he had walked into the room.

January 3, 2015

I would drive, this was before the medications, I would drive to work or home from work or somewhere else and I would scream as loudly and as violently as I could scream. My therapist told me a journal should be a series of letters to yourself in the future, that it's a sort of reverse time machine. I'm going to try it but it doesn't feel natural. It feels self centered or something.

Anyway, I would drive and drive and drive, you know, take the long way, and scream my throat to ribbons in search of this nanosecond of like psychic relief the screaming would produce. But it didn't happen every time I screamed, and I never felt like the source of the screaming, that self-consuming abyss I carried around, ever diminished, even a little bit.

So I would scream and drive and drive and scream but inside I still felt like a passenger jet at thirty thousand feet and some lunatic has opened the door and everything and everyone is rushing painfully and doll-like out of the beach with a deafening hiss like the sound of a giant tire just pictured with a switchblade.

No, it's not a passenger jet. It has to be some kind of spacecraft. Because of the crushing, the imploding, the sense that I've lost all internal pressure and there's nothing left inside me to push out against the heartless unstoppable physics of everything. Yeah, it's a spacecraft.

She drove three hours to the street behind the boardwalk where she first decided to try to survive by writing things. There were houses lining both sides of Wicker Lane, all on stilt and defined in a manner that shouted their owners had other homes, elsewhere, and these were just spare homes, second homes, *summer* homes. As if one's ascent to a certain tax bracket coincided with a sudden realization that they have been liberated from the suburban bondage of living in the same house, or even the same state, throughout all four seasons of the year. In fact, some of the members of the Wicker Lane Homeowners Association also owned a third home, many in and around the small mountain village of Milford, Pennsylvania. This, though, was their *winter* home, to which they retreated in late September as their ripened-tomato-hued sunburn faded away, losing its garish red glow as the trees lost their leaves.

She drove three hours to Wicker Lane and found herself preoccupied with its residents, with whom she has rarely spoken at all in her twenty-five years of life, three months a year, seventy five months in total of living and eat and sleeping at 306 Wicker Lane. She stood under the blown out street lamp (which had been blown out for as long as she could remember) and wiped the saltwater sheen from her glasses. Whatever she had come here for was not here, maybe had never been here, maybe has been a figment of her imagination, some sort of sad attempt at self mythologization. But the feeling, not the one she came to try to recapture but the one that had made her want to come and try to recapture something, was stubborn and would not be so summarily dismissed. And the worst bit was that she felt like the feeling she had come to recapture was just barely out of reach, a word you're trying to think of but can't but you know if you keep trying you probably will. So she stood there, for a long time, long enough to regret having quit smoking and to start jonesing for a cigarette.

The top portion of the dress shoe separated from the sole directly in front and to the right of the first toe of the left foot. He noticed it while he got out of the car this morning, far too late to do anything about it, short of perhaps simply and inexplicably disappearing and not going to work at all today. He didn't disappear though, instead he began walking from the rear parking lot of the Morrison Valley Office Park, around the winding overgrown cement pathway, past sad-looking trees that maybe once looked vital trees but now looked almost like three-dimensional black and white photographs of trees and between two waist-high square stone pillars which once must have been white judging by the odd shade of off-gray they had developed over the years and one of which, the left one, had a large empty Folgers coffee grounds can on top of it, filled a third of the way with cigarette butts and here and there the errant gum or candy wrapper.

This walk felt longer than it usually did because he had seen the rip in the shoe and now the rip in the shoe was a rip in his morning and a sort of a psychic rip the thoughts about which he could not interrupt however hard he tried to think about other things. Every step shouted at him that he *looked* poor, unkempt, unprofessional and while the steps shouted, his mind shouted back that he *is* poor but usually fairly well-kempt and while perhaps not executive-grade classy certainly what is commonly called a consummate professional. This contentious conversation had reached fever-pitched, in his mind, he hoped, when he saw the front entrance approaching in his periphery and, extending his arm and putting out his hand, leaned on the door with the extra effort doors like this door required to get them to swing open long enough for a human being to pass through before the commencement of the unforgiving back-swing of their hydraulic closers.

But there was no door, not where he attempted to place his hand for the forward assault typically necessary to enter the building. Rhonda Daniels, the fifty-six year old security guard, retired police officer, mother of three children and grandmother to no fewer than twelve grandchildren ranging in age from three and one half years old to twenty years old, had seen him approaching as she made her way from the security desk to the front door for a cigarette break and held the door open for him.

His motion resembled the trajectory of one of those foam darts fired from air pressure-powered pump-action toy guns insofar as for the first several feet he was, as a result of the aforementioned effort expelled in the direct of the door, parallel to the overwaxed but somehow still dull tile floor of the lobby of the Morrison Valley Office Park Building Number One (one of, it should be noted, only one building in the Park and therefore inexplicably named Building Number One). But, as quickly as a rubber-suction-cup-tipped foam dart, that parallelism gave up the ghost to a negative pitch angle that arrested his forward motion and subjected him to the full unmitigated consequences of gravity.

It was that time of day when night started to creep in at the edges, dark enough to activate those sensors that turn yard lights on but too bright to keep them from flickering. Canal Road was a winding stretch of river-side driving you had to do with a combination of total concentration and the sort of flow you only find on a waterslide or while skydiving.

It's all painful, just some of it is more familiar than other bits, so it's easier to suffer through. That's what you tell someone who is hurting for the first time. Anything else is dishonest and constitutes only deferred infliction of further pain.

Miranda sat with her feet crossed at the ankle, arms folded in front of her chest and a grimace on her face of such extremity that were it not for the rest of her body language it would be difficult to tell whether she was truly disgusted by something or that's just how she looks all the time. Court-ordered counseling is a strange thing in Carvin County. You are obligated by the court order only to show up and remain until the counselor tells you you can go home.

You can fully participate, discussing in excruciating detail the lack or overabundance of attention earlier in your life which led you to [insert crime from which this requirement resulted] and how hopeful you are that now you can finally, now that you've been pushed and pressured and truly *required* under threat of jail to do it, invest yourself fully and faithfully in the long and winding road you've been told recovery or rehabilitation or coping or learning-life-skills-finally will undoubtedly be for you.

Or, you can sit, with your feet crossed at the ankle, your arms folded in front of your chest and a grimace on your face.

You wouldn't believe it if she told you but Miranda is a verifiable saint when it comes to just about anyone except those with whom she is required by order of court to speak about her innermost feelings and thought processes. A marijuana arrest is a strange thing, especially in a mountain town where there is frankly just nothing else to be doing when you're sixteen and profoundly lacking in athletic talent.

Her uncle Harold Simmons was a founding partner at the well-known local litigation firm Conran, Simmons & Bates LLC. He was a short round man with John Lennon glasses, a thin mustache and a tendency to mumble in common conversations. But when he stood before a judge or a jury he was eloquent, forceful and mesmerizing. It was really something to see, especially when he was in front of the presiding judge for the first time. They always eyed his rotund mumbling frame with the disdain common to those expecting incompetence.

But then he opened his mouth and, in a slow and clearly enunciated river of argument subjected opposing counsel and the judge to the verbal equivalent of a check in chess. His position may not be insurmountable (thus "checkmate" would be inaccurate here) but it was dominant from the outset and remained formidable to the final gavel. He often won, but not always. He prided himself on leaving those who defeated him in court with the nagging suspicion that their victory had come by some mistake or would be easily overcome by subsequent filings. He was, simply put, a true nightmare to his opponents while in court, and one that tended to stick in their minds for weeks after.

But Harold was also known for nursing his weekly Friday happy hour beer at the local dive bar McGlinchey's, which still allowed patrons to smoke inside despite the decade-old ban on that very activity. The owners had overcome numerous complaints about this ignorance of the law because they counted among the bar's ranks of smokers, aside from Harold and several other local litigators of various levels of experience and talent, no fewer than six policeman from four different nearby counties.

The dream is always the same. George Jones is standing in front of a full-length mirror, looking at himself looking at himself looking at himself. He is in the vaulted-ceilinged-foyer of his grandfather's home, a crumbling monstrosity inartfully based on the estate at the center of much of the action, if you can call it that, of *Gone With the Wind*. He doesn't know how long he's been in front of the mirror but has the sense in his legs that he's been standing for a long time.

He blinks for what he thinks is the first time since the dream began and it starts snowing, inside the house, all around him but not directly onto him. The space above him and above the mirror is free of snow, which swirls around outside an invisible cylinder of stillness that rises all the way to the ceiling. He turns his head slightly to the left and looks over his shoulder at the elaborate staircase (cf. recent sentence regarding *Gone With the Wind*). A second him is sitting at the foot of the stairs, on the step second from the bottom. Other George is reading a book but First George can't tell which one. First George turns back to the mirror, realizing he can watch Other George in the mirror without craning his neck.

Other Geortge is turning pages far faster than First George has ever been able to read but is making quiet, pensive noises and microexpressions that appear to be the result of his reading whatever he is reading from the the book First George can't see the title of.

A floor-to-ceiling anti-snow cylinder just like the one over First George and the mirror has formed now around Other George at his place on the stairs. The snow is coming down faster and thicker when it suddenly becomes television static, intangible but as ubiquitous as the snow had been. What had been silence until this point became they sound of a distant rushing stream or river.

It is three o'clock in the morning when Abigail Spalding wakes in a cold sweat from a nightmare she can't remember. Her bedroom window faces the neighboring apartment building and the moonlight in the alley keeps the room bright enough to read in when the moon is full. She sits with her back against the horizontal wooden slats of the bedframe. It's oak and it's unforgiving and she can feel the indentations they're putting across her back but still she is resting all of her sitting weight against them. She is exhausted, breathing like she just crossed the finish line last in a midsummer marathon.

She knows it was a nightmare because her hands are shaking the way a drunk's do when it's time for more wine or whiskey or whatever. Flashes of metal and smoke and the sense of being cut when you know the cut is far worse than it feels at first, like an inches-long papercut.


## CHAPTER THREE

They had wrapped a plastic bag around the smoke detector on the ceiling of their dorm room so they could smoke cigarettes while they completed capstone research papers and studied for finals. The room sat on the ground floor in the corner of a hundred-year-old house that served as a sophomore dormitory for those male students of Saint David's University who stayed awake until midnight the morning of the first day of campus housing registration.

I set the navigation with "Home" as the destination. I left the bank parking lot at the bank where I had first reported my debit card lost, ordered a new one, got a temporary one, and conversed with the bankers for thirty or so minutes, and when the navigation told me to turn right, I turned left. I repeated this oppositional navigation tactic until I ended up on the rural-ish edge of the central New Jersey, U.S.A. suburbs. The road became densly reed and on either side houses emerged as if from behind an ever-shifting green and gray and brown fog of pseudo-forest. Some houses were large and obnoxious, oddly seemingly built to be admired by others for their sheer opulence and scale but simultaneously being hidden behind the impressionistic amalgam of leaf and branch that shrouded each property. Other houses looked like they predated the forest, so entrenched were they within the trees that they appeared to have grown from the forest floor along with the forest itself. The first time I passed the entrance to the parking in which I'm writing this I realized too late that it wasn't private property and couldn't stop, so I drove on a bit and turned around. DANGER: HUTNING IN PROGRESS - BY PERMIT ONLY. The sign at the entrance brought out the pedant in me: Danger by permit only? Hunting in Progress (like, the town of Progress?). The normatively socialized part of my brain knew the second choice was correct, but knowing did nothing to silence the unease murmuring in my mind about this poorly worded sign. I continued driving, over a short bridge that looked of questionable stability and craftsmanship but, being only a meter or so from the ground below posed, I decided, no threat to life or limb. I parked and started reading and drinking the coffee I brought and took my second dose of the day's bupropion, an antidepressant (and smoking cessation medication) used as an alternative or supplement to first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like fluoxetine, of which medication I was taking only one daily dose. The combination kept the more disheveled thoughts of hopelessness, self-loathing and misanthropy mostly at bay, most of the time. I was reading a novel on a digital device designed specifically for reading, an e-reader. I won't say what novel because you would think I was posturing or showing off or lying to inflate my literary cache beyond the small amount to which I am legitimately entitled. And also because the author probably wouldn't be pleased I was reading it on a digital device instead of out of a paper book. He is dead, though, the author of the book I am reading on the e-reader, so he cannot learn of that fact, but, you know, it's the principal of the thing. Anyway, I'm reading and reading and roll down my two front windows to let the cloudy day's cool forboding-of-rain breeze through my car. A Jeep and a Subaru pulled in, slowing not only enough to enter the parking lot safely over the bridge but to contemplate the meaning of finding a person, me, parked in a car, mine, who and which they had not expected to find. I opened the audio recorder on my mobile phone and pressed RECORD. One man emerged from each car and the two proceeded very nearly in unison to replace sneakers, tennis shoes, with boots, put on the camoflauge shirts that matched the camoflauge pants in which they had arrived, remove too-large-for-a-daypack backpacks from their vehicle, and finally, to strap onto their backs a bow. They were in their middle to late twenties and one wore a bright orange cap intended to prevent other people from firing arrows at his head (to the extent those other people were not intending to hunt humans). Doors of cars were opened and closed, black straps were loosened and tightened, spray was applied from a can to keep insects away, but the men, this whole time, said nothing at all to one another and had not once looked even in a direction vaguely proximal to my own. It was a rare gift for someone who fancies himself a "writer" to find himself *in media res* and yet invisible, unheeded, observing without, contrary to Herr Schrödinger's theory of the cat, altering that which I observed. I pressed STOP on the audio recorder when the men were out of sight, put on headphones, began playing back the ten minutes of audio I had recorded while the men prepared to hunt, and listened to it while I wrote these words. And now, ina few minutes, I will retract the business end of my pen into its body with a satisfying CLICK, close the notebook in which I have been writing, start my car, exit the parking lot, and drive back into my life and out of this story, forever. I also came here to hunt, after all, and having caught a story, however inconsequential, I am done hunting for the day.

It isn't an easy thing to plan a kidnapping. There are logistical concerns, sure, but those can be dispensed with by a movie marathon and a few weeks of casing the subject and setting of the anticipated act. The really truly difficult thing about a kidnapping is the idea that, even if you manage to get on the same page with your target, who will inevitably be referred to as your victim in third party accounts of the incident, even if you convince him or her or it that really this kidnapping thing is more like a rescue mission and you're less of a criminal and more of a hero, even if you can do that the authorities with a capital A will be looking for you with red lasers coming out of there guns and their eyes and the news will say trite things about you they learned from that asshole who made fun of you at high school track practice but didn't ever actually know you at fucking all. There will be posters, oh boy will there be posters, with some shoddily sketched version of Neanderthal You or, even better, some awful just fucking awful photo you put in Facebook three years before because you were drunk and thought a selfie in a Santa hat with like integrated faux dreadlocks was not racist at all and definitely a funny idea. The worst part about perpetrating a kidnapping isn't he perpetrating, and it isn't really even the getting caught, although oh should avoid that if you can. No, the shitty thing about kidnappings is the pursuit of you by the authorities with a capital A between the moment someone notices your target is gone and someone finally catches up to you.

You can't convince an arrogant person that they're fallible, and that's the reason Frank Sinclair didn't yet know that he was twenty hours away from dying when he stepped into the convenience store between exits 3 and 4 on Route 23. It was ten o'clock at night and Sinclair had smoked his last cigarette more than three hours ago. The "open" sign flickered off and back on again every few seconds and made a quiet, steady humming noise from inside the storefront window. Sinclair turned the key in the ignition toward himself and the engine wound down to stop. He leaned back in the seat and tilted his neck back and up, letting out a sigh and saying out loud to himself "if I make it through tonight, if I just make it through tonight."

He slammed the door of his 1971 AMC Javelin and then leaned hard against it. It never closed all the way but this combination of maneuvers kept it from swinging open on its own. He looked up at the sign, "STOP-MART," it said in a harsh bright neon yellow that fought back the swallowing darkness of a desert night. The sign was so absurdly oversized for the small store it marked that Sinclair laughed aloud to himself. He pulled the door open and was startled when it slammed shut behind him. The clerk behind the counter did not look up from whatever he was reading, and Sinclair was the only customer in the store.

The counter, on his left when he came in, was lined in the front, at knee-level, with candies no one buys unless they're stoned or it's Halloween. The wall behind the clerk held a plethora of cigarette brands and types and flavors and spin-off products. There were cigars. There were the thinner, longer "blunts" popular with potheads for whom cigarette rolling papers did not accommodate a sufficient payload of weed. There was snus, snuff, chew, dip, vaporizer oils, and several oddities Sinclair had neither tried nor seen before. This was his first time in Arizona and strange tobacco products were not this first encounter with the unknown since he arrived in the arid zone.

Six isles stretched out on his right. The first included newspapers, magazines and pulp fiction titles lined up against the window. The next held, inexplicably Sinclair thought, a multitude of the same useless candy the front counter displayed, just in a wider array of sizes and flavors and no-brand knock-offs. The third isle over was full of household items like toilet tissue, mops, cleaners of all types and pet food. The one after that presented shoppers with boxed pasta, canned vegetables, powdered eggs and milk and other foods altered by human ingenuity to maintain long-term edibility, at least technically, scientifically, medically, if not as far taste and texture are concerned.

The fifth isle was for stationary, paper, envelopes, large pieces of poster board that spent months or even years on the shelf between elementary school show-and-tell projects left until the last minute by some child who lived far enough never to have been to the store before but close enough that their parents knew it was the only around-the-clock store for at least one hundred miles in every direction. There was a cardboard card hanging to the left of the poster board with a large bar code on it and the words "REORDER PACKING TAPE." The strange thing was that there were so many cardboard boxes of different sizes in that isle that it seemed kind of unlikely someone would have really needed *all* of the packing tape.

Isle six included the refrigerated wall and a series of four progressively larger top-opening freezers with glass tops and mostly that fuzzy sort of ice that collects on your stuff when it is freezer burned. Sinclair was scanning the fridge for something more interesting than water but less disgusting than the carbonated shit that passed for beverage in most of the United State of A. As he turned the corner and reached out to open the fridge and grab a "Fruity Water" his foot caught on something and he began, in what felt to him like slow motion, to fall over a blurry human-shaped silhouette.

Sinclair reached out for something to keep himself upright with but his hand slid frictionless across the front of the freezers, beaded with condensation. He thought to himself right before everything went black that he had never seen linoleum tile that closely before, and it had little flecks of color that looked like they, the flecks, had once been the dominant color of the tiles but time and the wear of feet had banished all but the small flecks from the tiles, making the floor appear to a standing person a dirty death-gray bluish tint.

***

Sinclair open his right eye and scanned the world around him. His left eye was swollen shut and even the smallest effort to open it sent pain shooting up his face and in thin wiry lines across his head. The thing wiry lines were what scared him the most. He tried to hold his head the way people hold their heads when they're pretty sure they've severely damaged their head and might need some sort of medical attention.

But he couldn't hold anything because he couldn't lift his hand because it was taped to his other hand with a prodigious amount of packing tape. It ripped the hairs from Sinclair's hirsute wrists every time he fought the binding. He spotted the clerk out of the corner of his good eye, still reading and still appearing not to have moved at all since Sinclair first came into the store. He started trying to figure out what he had fallen over and his eye came to rest on someone else.

The other person was decidedly deceased and, more alarmingly, bound in the same manner as Sinclair. There were no outwardly visibly signs of physical trauma, but somehow that was of absolutely no comfort to Sinclair. Instead he made an attempt to speak, which he immediately regretted because if the clerk was the only other person in the store aside from the dead guy laying on the floor across from Sinclair, it was probably the clerk that had tied him up, and probably the clerk who had killed the dead guy.

The clerk looked slowly up from his reading material and, changing his expression not at all, placed a bookmark and calmly closed what looked like a very large, very old book. Sinclair blinked and the clerk was standing over him, without having walked or jumped or spoken a word. The clerk leaned down and said into Sinclair's ear "This really isn't as bad as it looks." He wasn't smiling or leering or otherwise giving off a very strong sense of villainy, hostility or even unfriendliness.

The bell above the front door let out a sharp, shrill "ding, ding" as someone else entered the store. When Sinclair look away from the direction of the door to confront the clerk, no one was there. He looked back to the counter and saw the clerk, looking directly at him with his first finger raised to his lips to tell Sinclair to be quiet. He was about to disobey and let out a scream meant more to tell whomever had come in to leave right away than to get himself saved somehow, but a gravelly whisper in his head said "Don't, please don't, I'll explain." He looked back to the clerk, who shook his head silently in the affirmative and turned back to his book.

Sinclair knew he had hit his head hard and was now seriously worried that he had a concussion or was perhaps still actually totally and maybe even irrevocably unconscious, comatose or something. If this was some sort of hallucination, and possibly the last experience he was going to have of any kind, imaginary or psychotic or trauma-induced or otherwise, he was going to ride it out and see where it went.

The patron approached the counter, asked for a pack of cigarettes, gave the clerk a ten dollar bill, said "thanks" and left the store. *Why the fuck didn't I do that?* Sinclair thought to himself.

*You weren't going to leave that easily no matter what you did Mr. Sinclair.* The voice again, in his head, a loud sort to whisper, felt like it issued from a full 360-degrees around his mind. Once again he thought to himself that if this was it, why not play along?

*I wasn't even planning on stopping here, so how can it be that had planned somehow to detain me?* he thought to himself, glaring at the clerk behind the counter with his good eye.

*There's a pretty elaborate cover story to explain things like that, but I've never been able to remember enough details to make it believable.*

*A goddamn time machine, really? Why am I going to believe that? That's a terrible cover story, no wonder you can't remember it.*

*No, the cover is something about a covert intelligence agency to whom, for some reason that's among the details I can never remember, is interested in you as if that makes any sense at all to anyone who isn't already of a questionable pedigree of mental stability.*

*What then?*

*You already guessed: a time machine. Well, not exactly a time machine, but something similar enough that it isn't really worth explaining the differences between the two.*

*Okay, then one, why am I here, tied up, think-talking to a convenience store clerk who looks to be able to teleport? And two, who is the dead guy and why is he dead?*

*One, you can do a thing someone very important to me needs someone to do for them, and the think-talking as you call it is a story for another day, although I have to say you picked it up much faster than anyone else I've ever known. Two, the dead guy is the first guy I thought was you, and he's dead because when I tried to explain the situation as it stands at the moment, he must have had a heart attack. He had just passed out, I thought, hence the binding.*

*Okay, well, the situation as it stands at the moment, explain it. Oh, but first maybe get rid of this tape.*

*I'll explain first, and then, depending on your reaction, I'll get rid of the tape. Deal?*

"Deal, now start talking," Sinclair said out loud while the clerk pulled a chain on the OPEN sign and turned the door lock to the CLOSED position.

"The guys name was Alfred Bester, he wrote about telepathy, and teleporting, and he was, like, probably the father or the grandfather of cyberpunk and much of the science fiction floating around even today." Daniel was exasperated and trying to think of a way to make Rob see the obvious.

"Yeah, but this isn't that. This isn't telepathy. This isn't teleporting. This isn't *Star Trek* or *Star Wars* or anything with "Star" prepended to it. I don't know what the hell this is, but it's not those things," Rob said quietly, wanting to believe there was something more than a placebo effect between two friends going on.

"Just do it again and you'll see I'm right. I'm going to concentrate on my dad again, okay?" Daniel's father had died when he was ten years old after a nine-month coma induced by a brain aneurysm, putting an end to their weekly movie theater trips, baseball games and *Dungeons & Dragons* games. He never got over it.

He cried whenever his dad came up, which was pretty often because Daniel never really wanted to stop talking about him like he was still, just maybe late coming home from work or something. He was already sobbing, quietly, feeling guilty that he was using the worst thing that had ever happened to him to conduct an experiment with or really more accurately *on* his best friend.

Rob closed his eyes and almost right away he felt sick to his stomach. Tears came down his face. He was sobbing and growing dizzy as a nonlinear series of memories slid into and out of the forefront of his conscious mind. Daniel's dad featured in all of them, and Rob saw it all from Daniel's perspective. First, a really happy, joyful memory flashed, like the year Daniel's team won the teeball "championship" (when everyone is five or six years old and hitting the ball off of a rubber tee it's generous to call anyone a champion).

Then the sharp smell of latex and hand sanitizer and processed air filled his nose, and Rob saw the word "Nonresponsive" written across the top of a piece of paper on a clipboard hanging from Daniel's dad's hospital room door.

Then there was Daniel's earliest memory, of pressing his face against the mesh wall of his playpen while his dad did the same thing from the outside, giggling and laughing. It only lasted a few moments, but it was Daniel's first real memory, and having it all his life made it feel longer, more important, than maybe it would otherwise be.

Then Daniel's mom was arguing with a doctor who was talking quietly to her and trying to be patient and understanding of this wife's fear and confusion at the end of his eighteen-hour shift. What began as a one-way shouting match during which Daniel's mother just about lost her voice ended with her sniffling back sobs and at first hesitantly and then gratefully accepting a very out of character but admittedly sort of standoffish approximation of a hug from the doctor, while Daniel sat in a chair next to his dad's bed, babbling about the sad, sorry state of National League baseball to his unresponsive father.

The pain was something foreign to Rob, like literally a foreign object, and felt in his mind the same way he imagined a pen or a piece of shrapnel would feel in his body. It overwhelmed him, left him hyperventilating, trying to get enough air but feeling a drowning sensation, a hopelessness without a bottom or an end.

Daniel took him by the shoulders and shook Rob out of the trance or whatever it was he was in again. Rob was as overwhelmed by how at ease Daniel looked as he was by how unsettled he felt himself.

"I told you it's real. You can do it. You really can steal someone's sadness. What are we going to call it?" Daniel was excited, almost oblivious to the pained look on Rob's face and the sheer terror that had been there only a moment ago.

## Chapter Four

Duke Farms was the brainchild of James Buchanan Duke and electrical power and tobacco manufacturing tycoon. He bought 2700 acres of land around the Raritan River centered on Hillsboro New Jersey. His daughter was apparently 12 years old when he died and she decided to sue her mother for control of the land. The remaining 68 years of miss Dukes life are fascinating story but not the point of this paragraph.

The point is I'm sitting on a crescent shaped cement bench. Immediately to my right the wall of the bridge base meets, at a right angle, the Archway bordering the negative space beneath the bridge. An Indian family has descended from the main trail to have a look at the riverbank, speaking gregariously in what I deduce is Gujarati because the other widely spoken dialect in this region is Bengali and while I cannot speak it I can identify it by a certain cadence and timbre with which it is spoken and which sets it apart in my ears from other languages.

Dark clouds fill the sky in front of me Mas slivers of sunlight stab through the canopy of Pineneedles above and behind me. This is, now that the family has left, the most private space I have found here fuss far, buying a large zone roped off and guarded by signs saying "restricted access: employees only" which zone I momentarily crossed into before deciding to continue my exploration of the unrestricted bits of the park.

The hike to the spot was sunny and hot and sweat blossomed likes spilled ink across my back beneath my day pack. I have brought three apples, a bottle of water, a pack of crackers, headphones, this notebook, my paper copy of house of leaves by Mark Z Danielle Ulsky, my digital copy of infinite jest by David Foster Wallace, aviator style sunglasses which I never wear, several pens, and an empty paper cup from my morning coffee, stuffed with napkins to prevent leakage and nestled in the bag to avoid littering.

…

He repeatedly paused, looked up from the page and watched for the dimples in the water that would signal the start of the coming rainfall. A hawk shouted and fill in circles above the tree in the distance, the voices of multiple people multiple ages and from multiple families wafted over the ridge behind him and start stop fashion that was both singsong and unpleasantly cacophonous. Several people walked across the bridge bother children road bikes, he assumed, because the joyous shrieks past Doppler– Style overhead faster than the measure tones of the old invoices. He wrote honestly he would mention the small tangled not in his stomach which momentarily swelled whatever it sounded like other people would come into a mutual field of vision, and which would silently but suffocatingly explode whenever "sounded like" became "Just did". If he was honest he would explain that this was like walking around with the clothespin how the round ones index finger in so far as there was nothing life-threatening or even, rationally speaking, lastingly painful about a clothespin closed on your index finger but the thought of it, the mental stimulation of it stretched out over an entire day, That is the towering infinitesimal terror of daily anxiety, if he was being honest.

The rain has started slow and steady, and if it gets too voluminous to sit beneath, even shielded by the trees, I will retreat beneath the bridge until it becomes possible to return to the car without becoming drenched.

…

## Chapter 5

The gas light shone a pale yellow glow on Charles McKenna's face while he drove north on Route 80. McKenna had been driving with the light on for at least an hour and didn't expect the reserves to last much longer. It was 11:30pm and Brian Banner was asleep in the passenger seat, reclined well into the backseat area of the 2007 Toyota Corolla. Banner had suggested a stop for gas while the tank was still half full around sunset. Tall dense forest lined the road on both sides, occassionally broken by a steep rock face lined with metal wire mesh meant to keep falling rocks to a minimum. The headlights cut through a low-floating layer of fog, the beams quivering with every pothole and pebble. There was no more of the ambient light cast above the forest by nearby suburbs and the stars stared down with unsettling indifference as the Toyota made a loud coughing noise, heaved like an arrhythmic heart and choked on the last dropof gas in the tank.

Banner woke up while McKenna idled the car to the shoulder. He pulled the small lever near the bottom of the right edge of his seat, pushing himself up like using an eject button. "Why did we stop?" Banner asked, wiping sleep from his eyes with one hand and rolling the window down with the other to spit. McKenna opened his door but didn't get out right away. Instead, he just sat with his left foot on the grass and his left hand hooked on the roof of the car. A cold breeze blew across the car's cabin from the passenger side window over McKenna's face. "We didn't stop," he said, "the car did, because we've got no more gas." McKenna said it in an exhausted monotone that suggested he blamed Banner for this setback.

The fog deposited mist on their faces as it lazily breezed through the car from one side to the other. McKenna got out and walked around to the back of the car. "What're you doing Mac?" Banner asked as he stretched his legs, pointing them out the car door and holding them parallel to the grass until he felt the muscles loosen.

"I'm getting the gas can and regretting my lack of headphones, which lack dooms me to extended conversation in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere with a Banner who just woke up and has had no coffee and has no prospect of procuring said bev-"

"I got it, I got it, I'm sorry I asked." McKenna was painfully serious for a twenty-something cis-gendered hereosexual male white American. He hailed from the upper upper middle class and always behaved in a way that suggested he was somehow, despite his empirically demonstrable privilege, beset on all sides by life, society and everything. He and Banner were the sort of friends you saw together and thought had to be enemies or second-order friends once removed, brought together and abandoned by a mutual friend of a friend like some awful buddy movie.

George Damien was visibly uncomfortable at his first AA meeting. He ha been up drinking until 3:00am and when he had parked his car at Berger and Jamison LLP, where he was a glorified filing clerk referred to as a "management specialist" whatever the hell that meant, he had still been fairly drunk, with a churning stomach, pounding head and an inexplicable sense that somehow everything would be just fine.

It was only as he walked the path from the lot to the office building's revolving doors and simultaneously tilted into a potted plant, twisted his ankle, and threw up too little to give up the ghost to a fully projectile situation but too much to avoid a few telltale dribbles fdown his chin of an *Exorcist* sort of vomit.

After a brief moment of eye contact with peter the security guard, George returned to the parking lot, wretched up the bulk of the previous days' stomach contents, and searched the internet for the nearest AA chapter.

Rain ran down the windshielf and obscured the small-town main street stretching ahead of Annie's aging foreign sedan. The wipers provided momentary clarity every few seconds but she was still anxious. A timid driver all her life, she drove in the right lane of the highway, among the people at whom her dad had scoffed a disgusted *hmph*. Her grip of the steering wheel made her hands ache and she held her foot on the gas pedal in a tense podiatric sort of lockjaw. The torrential rain had brought her usually slow speed dangerously lower than usual. She pressed the button on her center console that activated the hazard lights and kept the car around an unsteady 40 mph. The lane to her left was a blur of 18-wheelers, SUVs an the impulsive purchases indicative of upper class midlife crises. The shoulder on her right was muddy. She saw several cars in her rearview mirror pulling over only to lean hard on their right wheels and get stuck.

Her cell phone rang, startling her and causing her to jump in her seat, slamming the brakes. A truck horn sounded right before blinding headlights shined in the rearview.
