# Night Drive

- friends driving to camp
- have been going annually since childhood, now counselors
- this time old shacks lining road, increasing in density
- pickup trucks parked nose-to-nose along one side of road, and then other side of road, and then both sides of road
- and then men, strange looking, milling about trucks
- then the men notice the drivers, whose car is stuck in a gear and going slower and slower
- men move to get into their trucks and one by one begin following them
- eventually car comes out of gear and speeds up, they lose control and crash into a ditch at the side of the road
- headlights pull up behind them and they are panicking and screaming
- someone knocks on window and starts screaming "look at me"
- they are full of abject terror when suddenly blue and red lights start flashing and they realize it's a cop trying to help them
