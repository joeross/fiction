# Chapter One

"It's uncomfortable, being called out on your own pretensions and your own bullshit. It's not normal, it doesn't happen to most of us most of the time. If you can get good at it, just middling good, not even very good or great, you have a distinct advantage. You aren't good at it, Sorry."

Dr. Robert Philson had spoken with Soren Bailey on three previous occasions as part of the eighteen-year-old's mandatory disciplinary probation. Saint Brendan's University had tried to expel Soren for a minor violation of the disciplinary code but failed. Soren himself believed this to be the result of his cleverly quoting certain passages from the University Disciplinary Manual which suggested his due process rights had been stomped on by his summary expulsion. In fact, it was the intercession of Soren's psychology professor, a good friend of Dr. Philson's, which kept Sorry enrolled at the school.

"Professor Tate asked me to keep him informed about how engaged you're being in our sessions. I can tell him you're wasting time with infantile games which appear meant to evade earnest conversation about why you're here. I can tell him you aren't the young man he described to me as being, I believe, in his colorful way of characterizing all people in one brief characterization of one person, 'one of the conscious ones.' Or I can lie, and tell him you've been really just so receptive to all of this and it's probably time to release you from the obligation early."

Sorry was never a big hair washer and had a greasy brown bird's nest on his head that looked out of place above his dull blue eyes. They looked perpetually sunken, the eyes, even in his chubbier phases, one of which he was right smack in the middle of during this conversation with Philson.

He had a small scar in the middle of his forehead from an unfortunate childhood meeting with the corner of a brick fireplace. This was the spot Philson looked at while the two conversed, mostly because Sorry's eyes darted around the room. Sorry only made eye contact when he felt in control of a situation and, while he was always listening and not just waiting-to-talk listening but actually really listening, he usually wasn't making eye contact in extended conversations with figures of authority.

"Mr. Philson, *doctor* Philson, may I call you 'doctor'?"

"Yes Sorry, I would prefer you called me Doctor."

"Dr. Philson. Okay. Doc. I have anxiety, as you know." Sorry had sunk so low in his chair that it was hard for Philson not to take it personally, and he was taking it pretty personally.

"So I'm told, Sorry, yes."

"Okay well I was basically treating my anxiety and trying to relax and just calm down when the Resident Assistant knocked on my door." Sorry was examining a stock photograph poster of a multi-ethnic group of college-aged people smiling, high fiving and jumping, captioned MAKE CHALLENGES OPPORTUNITIES.

"I know that, too. I read the disciplinary report and I spoke to, to Dean Baxter." William Baxter was a personal nemesis of Philson's, the latter having lost out to the former by only two grade point average points when the two were students at Saint Brendan's. The wince and shudder Baxter's name induced in Philson, at the precise moment in the statement at the beginning of this paragraph where the comma is, between the two instances of 'to', demonstrated how little two decades had done to soften the blow to his ego.

"Okay okay okay but what you definitely *don't* know because the report doesn't name the RA in question is that it was the RA's girlfriend who's also an RA but in the womens' dorm which means she didn't even have jurisdiction to check on me. Zero jurisdiction in terms of being in a position of authority in the mens' dorms."

"Sorry, Resident Assistants actually all have the same authority everywhere on campus. They are all obligated to perform certain duties under the Disciplinary and Honor Codes above and beyond what your average students have to do."

"But show me, show me where it says that, like, in the Code."

"Soren --,"

"*Sorry*."

"Yes, Sorry, Sorry, do you know what narcissism is?"

"I do, but I don't see how that affects me."

"Okay, we're going to take a different approach here. Forget about what happened. Tell me what you're doing now. This is a sort of a second chance for you, and it's something most people don't really come back from. Most people like you would have simply been summarily expelled. Yes, there's always the option to appeal, but we all know those appeals never really go anywhere. So you have a very unusual second chance here. How are you using it?"
