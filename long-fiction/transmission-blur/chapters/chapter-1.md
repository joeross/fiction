# Chapter One

"It's uncomfortable, being called out on your own pretensions and your own bullshit. It's not normal, it doesn't happen to most of us most of the time. If you can get good at it, just middling good, not very good or great, you have a distinct advantage. You aren't good at it, Sorry."

Dr. Philson had spoken with Soren Bailey on three previous occasions as part of the eighteen-year-old's mandatory disciplinary probation. Saint Brendan's University had tried to expel Soren for a minor violation of the disciplinary code but failed. Soren himself believed this to be the result of his cleverly quoting certain passages from the University Disciplinary Manual which suggested his due process rights had been stomped on by his summary expulsion. In fact, it was the intercession of Soren's psychology professor, a good friend of Robert Philson's, which kept Sorry enrolled at the school.

"Professor Tate asked me to keep him informed about how engaged you're being in our sessions. I can tell him you're wasting time with infantile games which appear meant to evade earnest conversation about why you're here. I can tell him you aren't the young man he described to me as, I believe, in his colorful way of characterizing all people in one brief characterization of one person, 'one of the conscious ones.' Or I can lie, and tell him you've been really just so receptive to all of this and it's probably time to release you from the obligation early."

Sorry was never a big hair washer and had a greasy brown bird's nest on his head that looked out of place above the dull blue eyes which looked perpetually sunken, the eyes, even in his chubbier phases, one of which he was in right smack in the middle of during this conversation with Philson.

He had a small scar in the middle of his forehead from an unfortunate childhood meeting with the corner of a brick fireplace. This was the spot Philson looked at while Sorry's eyes darted around the room while Philson spoke. Sorry only made eye contact when he felt in control of a situation and, while he was always listening and not just waiting-to-talk listening but actually really listening, he usually wasn't making eye contact in extended conversations with figures of authority.

"Mr. Philson, *doctor* Philson, may I call you 'doctor'?"

"Yes Sorry, I would prefer you called me Doctor."

"Dr. Philson. Okay. Doc. I have anxiety, as you know." Sorry had sunk so low in his chair that it was hard for Philson not to take it personally, and he was taking it pretty personally.

"So I'm told, Sorry, yes."
