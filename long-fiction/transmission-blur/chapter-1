# Chapter One

"It's uncomfortable being called out on your own pretensions and your own bullshit. It's not normal, it doesn't happen to most of us most of the time. If you can get good at it, just middling good, not very good or great, you have a distinct advantage. You aren't good at it, Sorry." Dr. Philson had spoken with Soren Bailey on three previous occassions as part of the eighteen-year-old's mandatory disciplinary probation. Saint Brendan's University had tried to expel Soren but failed. 

Soren himself believed this to be the result of his cleverly quoting certain passages from the University Disciplinary Manual which suggested his due process rights had been stomped on by the Universty's summary expulsion of him following an incident which we will deal with later. In fact, it was the intercession of Soren's psychology professor, a good friend of Robert Philson, which kept the kid at the school.
