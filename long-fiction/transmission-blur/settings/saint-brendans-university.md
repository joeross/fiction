Saint Brendan's University is a Jesuit educational institution situated in the center of a triangle whose points are Philadelphia, Scranton and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It is well-known for its psychology department, which routinely produces Ivy League graduate students.

It is also home to a small club of literature students who often sit in on psychology class sessions to steer the conversation toward literary theory and away from psychology itself.
