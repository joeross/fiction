Saint Brendan's University is a Jesuit educational institution situated in the center of a triangle whose points are Philadelphia, Scranton and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It is well-known for its psychology department, which routinely produces Ivy League graduate students.

The campus is green the way stock photos of outdoor team-building exercises are green. Half of the buildings are made of massive old bricks hewn from local rock and known by binomial phrases ending in "Hall" or "Dormitory." The rest are new construction with entire facades of glass, severe angles and crass hypersyllabic names starting with "Center" or "Institute."

This dichotomy has no dividing line and old and new buildings are scattered among each other all over the campus. 

The main entrance to campus consists of a large wrought iron archway more suited for a prison entrance than an institute of higher education. It rises up from either side of a shoulder-height wall of locally sourced stones. The peak of the arch sits atop a matching but separate gate through which most parents and prospective students make their first visit to the university.
