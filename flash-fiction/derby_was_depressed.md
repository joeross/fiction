The shade was not cool. Derby breathed slowly, rationing his exhalations in case the heat choked him again. It was not thinking weather. It was not launching weather. 

But when someone gives you a spaceship, it's rude not to use it. That's the worst bit: doing something for someone else that was their idea, that scares the hell out of you, that people for generations will praise you for having done even though you didn't want to do it. 

Derby was being triple-checked by the flight prep crew on a hot Tarmac, summer swelter making the craft ripple like a stone-thrown lake in the distance. Its monstrous shadow did nothing to cool the situation, and its hulking mass made Derby uneasy. 

"Don't pay too much attention. It will be over before you know it happened."  Training triggered certain thoughts at certain times, but the emotional resonance had long ago passed out of these departure rituals. After all, Derby Michaels was not an explorer or a scientist, a poet or a warrior. 

He was an exterminator, and the exotic and extraterrestrial nature of his prey did not change the fact that he spent most of his time in space killing near-defenseless and totally indescribable life forms, just in case they could someday prove an obstacle to the broader Terran space travel agenda. 

Derby was depressed.
